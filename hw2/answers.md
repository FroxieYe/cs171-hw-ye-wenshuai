## 1. Improving the table presentation

##### 1.1. Looking at the page containing the table, what are the differences between the DOM as shown by the DOM inspector and the HTML source code? Why would you use the DOM inspector? When is the HTML source useful?

* HTML source code shows what was received from the server before javascript modifies it. However, Dom inspector allows us to see what it looks like at the moment. Namely, if you want to view the dynamic state of the code, DOM inspector is the way to go. However, it will correct html errors automatically. As a result, if you want to know where you have made a mistake in the html, HTML source code will be better.

##### 1.2. Below we have partially reproduced the first lines from the table's dataset. What piece of software generates this table? Where are the original data stored?
